# Graceful Degradation

Service workers seem to be a direct application of the ideas behind graceful degradation. For example, if we start with a working app that uses the network, then with service workers, we can enable the page to not be dependent in the high level technologies like the network which might not be reliable on older devices. In this case, we increase reliability since even for faster and more reliable devices, we reduce the dependence of our site on something we can't controll, the user's network, and degrade our dependence on "max technology".
